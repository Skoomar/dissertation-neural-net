Use functions in MAIN.py to run the models

Produce the merged WISDM set by downloading the original one and putting the path into merge_wisdm_sensor_data.py

WISDM dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WISDM+Smartphone+and+Smartwatch+Activity+and+Biometrics+Dataset+

Then put the path to that merged set into MAIN.py

Python 3.7.10

Tensorflow 2.4.1 (specifically the GPU implementation but can be run on the normal CPU version)
> for the GPU implementation, used CUDA 11.0 and cuDNN 8.04
